Geoguessr used to be free to play without registration, now it's very restricted. This is my attempt to make geoguessr great again. The idea is to make a temporary email, register it on geoguessr and play one round uninterrupted, then repeat. In the future email addresses can be stored an reused in 24 hours.

Using the www.developermail.com api to get temporary mailboxes for now.
